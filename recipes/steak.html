    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>One of my other favorite foods that I&rsquo;d like to teach you to cook is Steak. Steak is primarily lean meat that comes from a cow, but sometimes theres exceptions to that. However, today we will be focusing on steak from cows. Specifically, an especially sought after breed of cows called Wagyu. This is an extremely easy recipe to follow or memorize, and I hope you enjoy your steaks when they&rsquo;re cooked this way as much as I do!</p>
