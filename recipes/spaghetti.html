    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Spaghetti is a perfect blend of tomato sauce, meat, and noodles.</p>
      <p>To start, we&rsquo;re going to add meat to medium high heat. Once we get our meat to a nice brown color, we can add in our vegetables and tomato sauce. Cook on high heat for 10 minutes, and then cook the spaghetti for an additional 50 minutes on low heat. When your meat sauce has about 30 minutes left, you can add your noodles to boiling water and cook to your liking. </p>
